      "content": "I had to return the first one I ordered because it was a tad too small so I browsed again after returning that one and found this one for basically the same price and it has loads of room. The main compartment is huge and padded enough that I feel safe with my expensive gaming laptop in it. There are also other zippered compartments so I was able to also pack my full size keyboard, my trackball mouse, and of course my power supply for the laptop and is still has another zippered compartment for files or manuals, documents, etc. I didn't think I would ever use that one but it has already come in handy. The zippers can be zipped shut so they come together at the top and I got a set of small same keyed padlocks for luggage,etc. and now I can lock the compartments too. I know it could still be stolen if left out somewhere but I still like the fact that not even my friends or family can snoop in my laptop case if I were to leave the room for a minute if we were out together, like if one of us was in the hospital or somewhere that I expect a long wait and might want to use my PC. You could even put a gps tracker inside if you were that worried about it being stolen but I keep a close watch on mine. I don't worry about it when I am at home but I just feel safer with it locked if I take it out somewhere with me. Even if you have a small laptop I would still highly recommend this. It was the best quality laptop case I could find and the price is very reasonable compared to some expensive ones I looked at and didn't even like. If you need a good laptop case that will hold all your accessories then snatch this bag up while you can. In this economy, prices are getting higher every day  on everything and it is only going to get worse. You won't be sorry you got this one.",

Because of various health issues, I have to carry a lot of stuff around with me on a daily basis, and this bag is perfect for me. I don't know what it is with this bag, but my stuff seems to weigh much less in this bag than in the last one I had, and I didn't get rid of anything. Everything fit easily in this new bag and I still have plenty of room to put more items in if I want to.The only complaint I have is the smell. The item was packaged in plastic, and when I opened it, there is a very unpleasent odor coming from the bag. To me, it kind of smells like the spray of a stink bug. I've been using the bag for a week now, and the odor is still fairly strong. I'm hoping it will dissipate over time. It's not a complete game changer, but I won't lie....if I had another bag to use until this one aired out, I'd probably use it.",

Stuff like gum, advil, napkins, kleenex, portable utensils, granola/nut bar, etc.• The Apple Pencil is too tall to fit in the pen/pencil compartments and still be able to zip the pocket closed. My phone had to fit horizontally in one of the organizing pockets.• I really like the feel of the fabric and the cushion on the arm strap. I walked around my house for a bit and it seems pretty comfortable.• Unzipping the extended portion was a must for how I wanted my stuff to fit.That's pretty much it. If you travel light then this is a great bag. If you like to bring or need to bring more with you, then I think a bigger bag would be a better fit.",

There are also two separate compartments, one on each side of the bag, for additional storage.  One side has dedicated storage for pens/pencils and this makes for great stowing for notebooks and other materials.  The bag is easy to carry with the handle and the strap feels secure and rests easy over the shoulder.The build quality seems pretty good, I did not observe any deformities with the stitches or issues with zippers.  I'm very satisfied with the quality of the product, it's storage capabilities while maintaining a slim fit at such a reasonable price.  Would not hesitate to recommend this to others with 17\" laptops.",

      "content": "I recently got my hands on this laptop bag, and I have to say, I'm absolutely loving it for my daily use. It's become an essential part of my routine, and here's why.First and foremost, the build quality took me by surprise – in the best way possible. It's one of those rare cases where you can judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a bag by its zippers. The zippers are top-notch, and I've always believed that zipper quality is a good indicator of how well-made something is. This bag passes the zipper test with flying colors.Now, let's talk about space – this bag is incredibly roomy. As a self-proclaimed serial over-packer, I often carry more than just my laptop. In this bag, I can comfortably fit not one but two laptops, along with various chargers, pens, notepads, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous items (think gum, AirPods, and even a pocket knife – just in case!).So, if you couldn't tell, I tend to over-prepare for life's little surprises. This laptop bag doesn't judge; it accommodates all my quirks with ease. It's a fantastic companion for anyone who, like me, tends to carry their whole world in their bag. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I'd highly recommend it to fellow over-packers and organized chaos enthusiasts out there.The one con: I can't fit my 36oz yeti in there comfortably! My solution is using a carabiner and it can rest comfortably on top of my bag while clipped on.",

      "content": "This spacious 15-15.6 inch laptop bag is well-built, and the main compartment easily fits my OMEN HP 15 Gaming Laptop. FYI, my laptop dimensions are: 14.17 x 10.35 x 1.02in (W x D x H). Additionally, it has enough room to comfortably fit the following gear:1). A fairly large A/C power adapter;2). A full-sized corded Logitech G500s gaming mouse;3). A USB-C cable that's more than 6 feet long;4). The included shoulder strap that came with this sleeve;I was then able to easily fit the loaded laptop bag into a regular size JanSport school backpack. I can probably fit my cell phone in it and a few other small items as well.The build quality material on the Voova Laptop Bag is excellent and appears to be durable and tough enough to last for many years to come. In my opinion, this bag is sufficiently padded to withstand and protect my laptop from accidental drops and falls.With the added feature of converting to a shoulder carry bag, this sleeve is a very good value for the price. This laptop bag has all of the features and functionality that I was looking for, and I heartily recommend it.",

The front pocket fits writing utensils, smaller notebooks, or even another smaller book on top of the aforementioned. There is a zipper across the bottom that expands the storage compartment by a little under an inch.The strap is adjustable for optimal length & has a movable pad for comfort. If you’d rather carry the bag, it has 2 handles that can be strapped together; these handles can easily carry the bag with considerable weight (like I said, I usually have a laptop, a couple notebooks, & couple books at any given time).Overall great bag, I recommend.",

I can't remember)4 chargers and 4 respective cordsWalletIn the back compartment:11in 2020 Ipad Pro2nd Gen Apple Pencil (magnetized to ipad)In the front, organizing pocket:PhonePassport (if we can ever travel again)2 pocket sized booksAnd I clipped the case of my over the ear headphones to one of the metal loops.First impressions after loading it up:• The front organizing pocket fills up rather quickly, but it seems like there's still room for the random airport purchases that are predictable yet I always forget before I leave. Stuff like gum, advil, napkins, kleenex, portable utensils, granola/nut bar, etc.• The Apple Pencil is too tall to fit in the pen/pencil compartments and still be able to zip the pocket closed. My phone had to fit horizontally in one of the organizing pockets.• I really like the feel of the fabric and the cushion on the arm strap. I walked around my house for a bit and it seems pretty comfortable.• Unzipping the extended portion was a must for how I wanted my stuff to fit.That's pretty much it. If you travel light then this is a great bag. If you like to bring or need to bring more with you, then I think a bigger bag would be a better fit.",

There are also two separate compartments, one on each side of the bag, for additional storage.  One side has dedicated storage for pens/pencils and this makes for great stowing for notebooks and other materials.  The bag is easy to carry with the handle and the strap feels secure and rests easy over the shoulder.The build quality seems pretty good, I did not observe any deformities with the stitches or issues with zippers.  I'm very satisfied with the quality of the product, it's storage capabilities while maintaining a slim fit at such a reasonable price.  Would not hesitate to recommend this to others with 17\" laptops.",

      "content": "I recently got my hands on this laptop bag, and I have to say, I'm absolutely loving it for my daily use. It's become an essential part of my routine, and here's why.First and foremost, the build quality took me by surprise – in the best way possible. It's one of those rare cases where you can judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a bag by its zippers. The zippers are top-notch, and I've always believed that zipper quality is a good indicator of how well-made something is. This bag passes the zipper test with flying colors.Now, let's talk about space – this bag is incredibly roomy. As a self-proclaimed serial over-packer, I often carry more than just my laptop. In this bag, I can comfortably fit not one but two laptops, along with various chargers, pens, notepads, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous items (think gum, AirPods, and even a pocket knife – just in case!).So, if you couldn't tell, I tend to over-prepare for life's little surprises. This laptop bag doesn't judge; it accommodates all my quirks with ease. It's a fantastic companion for anyone who, like me, tends to carry their whole world in their bag. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I'd highly recommend it to fellow over-packers and organized chaos enthusiasts out there.The one con: I can't fit my 36oz yeti in there comfortably! My solution is using a carabiner and it can rest comfortably on top of my bag while clipped on.",

FYI, my laptop dimensions are: 14.17 x 10.35 x 1.02in (W x D x H). Additionally, it has enough room to comfortably fit the following gear:1). A fairly large A/C power adapter;2). A full-sized corded Logitech G500s gaming mouse;3). A USB-C cable that's more than 6 feet long;4). The included shoulder strap that came with this sleeve;I was then able to easily fit the loaded laptop bag into a regular size JanSport school backpack. I can probably fit my cell phone in it and a few other small items as well.The build quality material on the Voova Laptop Bag is excellent and appears to be durable and tough enough to last for many years to come. In my opinion, this bag is sufficiently padded to withstand and protect my laptop from accidental drops and falls.With the added feature of converting to a shoulder carry bag, this sleeve is a very good value for the price. This laptop bag has all of the features and functionality that I was looking for, and I heartily recommend it.",

The front pocket fits writing utensils, smaller notebooks, or even another smaller book on top of the aforementioned. There is a zipper across the bottom that expands the storage compartment by a little under an inch.The strap is adjustable for optimal length & has a movable pad for comfort. If you’d rather carry the bag, it has 2 handles that can be strapped together; these handles can easily carry the bag with considerable weight (like I said, I usually have a laptop, a couple notebooks, & couple books at any given time).Overall great bag, I recommend.",

Of course because they are made strong and durable. Then, I saw this bag. Way cheaper than the bag I already had for my laptop but you know, once I started using this Lenovo bag I never did go back to its more expensive counterpart. Why? Well because unlike the Timbuktu this is a top loader and has very easy access to things. The other bag is also a top loader but has a flap that needs to be folded away in order to reach for the items. Also, and by the way this is just my pet peeve to bags lol. When I carry the Timbuktu like a briefcase, the weight of the bag contents are not evenly balanced. The Lonovo bag has its handles on the top two sides and makes carrying around comfortable. Of course the Timbuktu has all these pockets and slots for organizing and the Lenovo does lack those features. Plus the Lenovo doesn’t repel rain but I still am using even if it’s raining out and my MacBook Air and phone and chargers are all dry. It’s a good laptop bag. It’s not the best but it could be once you get used to it. Thanks for your time!",
