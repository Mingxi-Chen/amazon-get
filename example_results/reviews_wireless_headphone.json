      "content": "Fantastic sound and fit! I got these during the special Prime sale for $15. I thought for $15 I’d try them…not really needing them or so I thought. I listen in bed a lot with a pair of bone conduction earphones. It does the trick for simple listening to reviews of items and stuff like that but the sound quality is meh. So here are my first impressions.Packaging - this comes in a small box that keeps the earbuds secure and is very easy to open. Once opened you are greeted by very simple instructions that guide you to your Alexa app.Setup - once in the app, it recognizes the earbuds instantly and asks if you want to set them up. I pressed yes and was set up in no time.App - it says that you need an app so I pressed to get that. I was taken to the App Store where I didn’t see an echo buds app but instead the Alexa app that I already had. So I’m not sure if it simply updated the app or what. But it did everything quickly and I was onto the next step. The app is simple to use and lets you adjust the bass, mids and treble - which I instantly used to set it to my preference. I do not like not having an eq for headphones so this was a pleasant surprise. I do wish there were a way to save custom presets so I could quickly change the settings for let’s say pop to classical music.Use - I quickly downloaded Sirius XM and was off to listening to favorite stations in no time ranging from Christian worship to The Beach Boys to Rachmaninoff. The sound was crystal clear and very pleasing.  I’m an audio engineering professor and will actually incorporate these into my mixing repertoire as I have the ability to use Bluetooth headphones directly with Pro Tools. These will be perfect to check final mixes on what consumers listen to most now - ear buds. I will toggle between the professional headphones I use and these - which I think will inform my mixing decisions more.Fit - they just fit…this is the first pair of earbuds that I didn’t have to do any Messi by s around with/ just put them on and enjoy…no falling out and they are very comfortable.  After wearing them for a few minutes you forget they are on.  They can be worn for a long time because of how comfortable they are.Build quality - in addition to seeing professional packaging, it was great to see when I opened it how beautiful the case was. It is sleek and comfortable to hold. Opening the case you are greeted with two stylish earbuds - mine were the black variety. The actual earbuds are very nice looking with a shiny understated black and nice clear silicon that is the many part which grabs the earRecommendation - I highly recommend these for someone wanting a quality pair of earbuds buds in a decent price range. Even at the full $50 price they are wonderful. I would suspect they compete with earbuds that are more in the $100 range. I will likely compare them to my wife’s AirPods to check differences. I’ve had other EarPods in this price range and I can say these are definitely worlds above. I haven’t even gotten into the phone calling abilities…that next for me to try. But I suspect they will be great for that. They get wonderful reviews from major publishers like PC world.God bless and enjoy your new immersive earbuds!",

      "content": "I got these when they first came out and I've had them for about a month now. These are the first wireless earbuds I've ever purchased so I didn't know what to expect but so far I'm pleasantly surprised, especially considering how inexpensive they are.I think the sound is great. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can definitely tell that these have much better sound quality than my wired earbuds. My only complaint from a sound standpoint is occasionally there will be interference or it will cut out. I assume this is just par for the course for something that's wireless / bluetooth, but it can be annoying and there have been a couple of times I needed to reconnect them to clear up an audio problem. It doesn't happen enough for it to be a deal breaker though, and it could just be my phone as it never happens with computer audio.As far as Alexa integration, these work great. I barely have to say \"Alexa\" above a whisper for the earbuds to activate, which is great when I'm in public and don't want to appear like I'm talking to myself. It also helps if I don't want to trigger one of my nearby Alexa devices, although even if I do, the proximity awareness of echo devices means that if I have my earbuds in, my other echo's won't pick up the command, which is great.From a comfort standpoint, I think my opinion is going to be subjective, after all, everyone's ears are different. I can keep these earbuds in for up to two hours before I need a break. I don't like to keep the earbuds in when I'm not using them so I keep the case in my pocket and take the earbuds out when I'm not using them. That keep my ears from getting tired.I think the battery life is great. Again, I usually only keep them in my ears for around 2 hours, but there have been a couple of times that I've keep them in for 4 to 5 hours and they've almost run completely out of power. In those cases, 15 to 20 minutes in the case and they are good as new.In addition to all this, I really like the features of these earbuds. They were very easy to setup with the Alexa app. They seamlessly connect to my phone and laptop at the same time and I can listen to audio from either device at any time without having to do any type of manual switching. I can be listening to audio on my laptop and if my phone rings, it will pause whatever is playing on my laptop to give me an opportunity to answer the phone. The tapping gestures are programable and straightforward, and I have the ability to summon both Alexa and Google's Assistant  at any time either by voice or by a long-press.All in all, these are great. I'd say 4.5 stars instead of five, but since I can't do half stars, I feel like these are so good that it's better to round up than down. You honestly can't beat these for the price.",

      "content": "My ears don't tolerate in-ear monitors very well, but I've been wanting something small to keep in my bag to save my bulky over-ear and on-ear headphones from getting thrown around too much. I've heard old OEM Apple \"hard\" earbuds that shoot sound into your ear canal without actually occupying them and was impressed with the sound quality for a non-sealing earphone. Seeing these in photos, they looked like they'd offer the best of both worlds by sealing slightly (also keeping them in place better) but still offering a sense of ambient awareness and being less uncomfortable to my irritable concha cavum. What the pictures didn't depict was the silicone skin that fits around the body and helps hold it in place better and seal slightly more. You can remove it if it's not to your liking, but I left mine on because it does a great job of keeping them in place (even after vigorously shaking my head), and the supplemented bass is nice. I find I can wear these for about two hours before I start to get mild discomfort, much better than the 30 minutes or so with sealing in-ear monitors. In short, I'm a fan of the design and hope more brands take note.Sound quality is competent for the price. It's not \"hi-fi,\" but it's still enjoyable. You'll get about 90% of the bass response of a fully-isolating earbud, which is pretty dang good. If I were to sum it up, I'd say they did a good job squeezing the best sound possible out of cheap components. It's enjoyable and pleasant enough, but experienced ears can tell it doesn't have the finesse of a more expensive model, particularly in the highs. Ultimately, I think these are very reasonably priced.Bass, mids, and treble can be adjusted in the Alexa app, which is nice, but I think the \"treble\" slider digs too much into the upper mids, so you can't get more treble without also making it more shouty. All told, I left mine at near default, just a slight boost of the \"mids\" (which I'd personally consider low-mids). The sound is very agreeable out of the box.Speaking of app, I appreciate how easy it is to customize controls. You can assign what they do to taps (1, 2, 3, hold) per side. You can also disable them, which I appreciate.As for other features e.g. Alexa integration, I can't say much because I don't use them that way. I'm happy to report that these indeed can be used perfectly without the Alexa \"gimmicks\" (if you see that as such). Just in case it isn't clear to someone, these use Alexa on your phone--they do not have Alexa built in by themselves.Visually and material/build-quality-wise, they're acceptable but not impressive. Pretty non-descript appearance, and materials are merely adequate. I'm not worried about longevity/durability, but these don't feel luxurious at all (nor should you expect them to at this price and featureset).I can't quite comment on battery life yet because I've only been using these for around 10 hours total (up to 2hrs at once).

Excellent sound quality which is what I bought them for. Great casual headphones. Wouldn’t recommend for working out as they don’t stay in as easily as in ear buds, but they do great for general use.

I put them in and instantly knew they were going to stay in place and I wouldn't have to worry about losing something I just paid $100 for. I haven't yet tried them out for sound quality but if it's anything like the fit and the functionality which is exceedingly good I have nothing to worry about.",

I haven't yet tried them out for sound quality but if it's anything like the fit and the functionality which is exceedingly good I have nothing to worry about.",

      "content": "Amazon did a lot right this time around. I had issues with the first gen Echo Buds, enough to not keep them. Their case was large, it used micro-USB, the earbuds were bulky, and the noise reduction was mediocre. However, Amazon improved on nearly every aspect this time around. The charging case is smaller, it charges via USB-C with optional Qi compatibility, the earbuds are smaller, their sound quality is better, and the ANC is effective.I watched and read, what felt like, tons of reviews for these earbuds. Some complained about the ANC, others had issues with the overall build quality, and some reviewers said the earbuds were still bulky. I was worried that these weren't going to be able to compete with other earbuds and fall flat. That hasn't been the case. Amazon's 2nd generation Echo Buds compete with the Galaxy Buds Pro, AirPods Pro, and other premium ANC earbuds. Yeah, the ANC isn't as good as the AirPods Pro (or new Sony XM4 earbuds) but they're also at least twice as expensive as these (at least during Prime Day).The Amazon Echo app is required for setup, but you don't have to give Amazon access to everything. It requested my location when using the app (not all the time), it wanted access to my microphone but only uses it when the app is open and I trigger Alexa, and that's about it. Nothing was out of the ordinary and you aren't signing your life away to Amazon, unlike what some reviewers are making the Echo app out to be.I like the audio quality of the earbuds themselves. They have a decent amount of bass out of the box with details in the mids and highs. I adjusted their EQ to increase the bass and highs a couple of notches, which was about it. The audio quality still isn't as \"thunderous\" and booming as my PowerBeats Pro but it is better than standard AirPods, my Galaxy Buds+, and other earbuds in the $100-$150 range. I even like it better than my wife's AirPods Pros. The ANC is good, it's enough to cancel out office chatter, the fan in my office, and other things. It dulls the sound my keyboard makes and, when music is playing, I can't really hear anything. The earbuds get nice and loud as well. I haven't used these on a plane, but I think they would get the job done. The ANC isn't as good as $280 earbuds from Bose or Sony but that should be expected when buying $80-$100 earbuds (or even at their full price).I disabled Alexa from the get-go. I have an iPhone and prefer to use Siri. I adjusted the tapping controls, which actually work unlike the controls on earbuds from other manufacturers (I'm looking at you UE), so that tapping and holding on the right earbud triggers Siri. It works without issues. I may eventually enable Alexa once Amazon rolls out the feature allowing me to select which apps Alexa will read notifications from. Until then, I'll keep it disabled.The earbuds are comfortable, and I've been able to wear them for hours on end without issues. The medium ear tips fit my ears, but I did need to add the medium sport fins. Three different size fins and four different ear tips come in the box, the medium for everything fit my ears. It doesn't matter if I'm walking, bending over, laying down, or sitting upright. The earbuds comfortably stay put without me having to adjust them or feeling like they're falling out of my ears.My only real complaint is battery life. The Echo Buds 2 compete with the AirPods Pro in terms of battery life, but 5 hours isn't much when compared to other earbuds. It's not bad but it could have been better. Amazon went with RealTek for the bluetooth in these instead of Qualcomm, the latter focuses more on efficiency. Amazon could have sacrificed efficiency for having a solid connection. These have skipped once on me when I was outside walking next to electrical equipment, I don't think that's bad at all. Still, 5 hours with ANC isn't much and the two additional charges out of the case aren't a lot either. I would expect at least 3 additional charges out of the case at this point.That's my only gripe against these. Amazon made a solid pair of earbuds that have become my daily drivers. They would have been fine at $140 but are even better at $100. Definitely pick up a pair this Prime Day or the next time they're on sale. I also recoomend buying the companion Anker charging pad. These will work with any Qi charger but the Anker pad is small, has an indendation for the Buds 2 case, and there are status lights for the earbuds and case on the pad.",

      "content": "EDIT/UPDATE: I cannot say this was a result of my own review, but I have raised my review rating by a star to account for this - it seems Amazon through a software update was able to add support for multipoint bluetooth connectivity. As my millennial friends would say, this is an absolute flex on Google, for they only months ago released their Pixel Buds Pro, with multipoint BT connectivity as a flagship feature, but leaving their a-series, gen 1 and gen 2 Pixel Buds users without the feature.Coming from a technical background, I know this can be difficult for other bluetooth device manufacturers to do, most of the time they're using off-the-shelf BT adapters which they cannot update the firmware on themselves (they have to talk with whoever manufactured the bluetooth adapter), and in other cases, its impossible to update it without ripping it out of the device first.Amazon is showing Google up by using their control over the hardware and software of the buds to add features never even dreamed of by the team who designed and released these buds (as evidenced by the lack of mention on the product page), and the fact that I received this in a free software update makes my day.For those curious, my buds are on software version 603267242 and the case is on 602808458. You can enable multipoint by going to the settings page for your Echo Buds and using the \"connected devices\" section to put them in pairing mode. Using the normal pairing mode method (buds in case, lid open, pressing and holding button until blue light flashes), might not cause them to pair in multipoint mode.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Having owned my current pair of Echo buds for nearly a year now, I feel I can give a sufficiently detailed review on them.Case/Chassis:The case itself has a nice sleek design with a slight indent on the side that the lid opens from, allowing you to easily pull the lid open. It's small enough to fit into my jeans pocket alongside my keys and wallet, without falling or sliding out. It can fit into the vestigial pocketwatch pocket, but only barely and peeks out to a degree. The hinge feels a little weak, as if a strong enough force applied to the lid could bend its connection out of snap it entirely, and it feels a touch loose, the main body of the case has a sort of raised section that fits into an indented section of the lid. This gives the lid strength when held closed by its magnets and redirects any forces applied to the lid into the main body of the case.Sound Quality:Better than my car speakers; with the listening modes such as ANC and passthrough turned off, the sound quality is actually rather pleasant. I have unpaired my phone from my 2019 car and use my Echo Buds exclusively in the car when driving, for music and calls since it sounds so much better. Mind, it is recommended that you use the in-app EQ to turn down mids and treble by one or two ticks to even out the sound profile, especially if you listen to bass-heavy music.Fit:Good enough, there are a few pressure points where the body of the earbuds press against my ears and to achieve the recommended fit I have to use tips that are slightly larger than preferred. I could improve comfort by under-sizing the tips and using the wings to keep them stable, but the wing design would worsen the pressure points between my earlobe and the main body, making that the pain-point. I love the color-matched mesh inside the tips, making it easy to tell which size each tip is, and if I am using asymmetric tips (because some people have asymmetric ears), it can help keep track of which bud goes in which ear. In short, I have a listening time of 1-3 hours before the pain gets to me and I have to give my ears a rest... This isn't too bad since the battery is supposed to last 4-5 hours (depending on ANC being enabled, and if I reduce the depth of discharge then it can improve battery lifespan (ex: discharging a battery from 100% to 75% twice is better than going from 100% to 50% once).Battery:Truly wireless earbuds have some of the smallest batteries found in electronics, and manufacturers will push them to the limit to hit lovely marketing figures. Google's new pixel buds pro advertise a listening time with ANC of 7 hours. After a year of use, I can confirm that my Echo Buds are still hitting at least 3-4 hours of listening time with ANC enabled. The case holds about 2 spare charges in it, and I find the combined 9-15 hours of listening to be more than enough for most purposes, especially considering I have to take breaks every 3 hours anyhow.Charging:This is the only failure of the Echo Buds. I like the use of a USB-C charging port, and the optional upgrade for a wireless charging case. After losing multiple phones to charging port failure, I resolve to only purchase devices with wireless charging from now on, and that resolution is why I held off on getting the first-generation Echo Buds. Since the case is more vertical than it's predecessor, that limits the size of the internal wireless charging coil, and resultingly, the buds have issues trying to charge on a charging pad with too large an internal coil. It will handshake, and initiate the charge, giving the user a pleasant blinking green light, and then fail minutes later - this is an issue I saw even with the official Anker charging pad. Worse yet, for some reason the buds seem to always be warm after wirelessly charging for any length of time longer than 5 minutes. I have deducted one star from my review as a result of this.Connectivity / Smarts:The buds are actually fairly nice when it comes to connecting via bluetooth and integration with the Alexa app, Alexa is a pleasant enough assistant and it is nice to be able to turn on and off lights, heaters, AC units, etc as I'm driving away from or towards my home. I have found no issue with the bluetooth connectivity, even in densely crowded areas such as an airplane. Triggering an assistant via a voice command requires their wake-algorithm be running on the receiving device, and since Google and Apple are not going to give Amazon the algorithm required to trigger their assistants via a wake word, this means you're limited to Alexa for truly hands-free operation. That being said, you can setup the Alexa app to trigger your phone's native assistant by pressing and holding one of the buds for 2-3 seconds.***THIS POINT IS MOOT, SEE ABOVE***Despite this, there is room for improvement in regards to bluetooth... They need multi-point bluetooth to be really useful. Amazon should want me to be able to swap between my cell phone, and a Fire Tablet, or a Fire TV at will, and ideally even my PC or steamdeck when mine finally ships. Currently, the best option is to pair and unpair it with multiple devices at a time, which is annoying since to pair (without resetting), you must hold the lid open whilst pressing the button until the light flashes blue. This isn't enough to deduct a star, but Amazon should take it into consideration with the third-gen buds, or in the form of a software update if at all possible.***THIS POINT IS MOOT, SEE ABOVE***Touch controls:At launch, the touch controls were laughably limited in scope, you could only customize what the long touch+hold did. After a few updates, the other touch patterns (single, double, triple) can be customized to an extent, and they're acceptable if barely. Unfortunately, they're capacitive sensors, so they can be triggered by anything touching the buds. The Alexa app also provided limited guidance on how best to trigger them, which caused some frustration at first. For those with these buds: you will want to gently but assertively (eg: the minimum amount of force needed for your finger pad to flatten against the surface) press your finger against it for about a half second per press/tap. Do not angrily tap it like you're hitting a key on your keyboard, it'll only miss the touch.Microphones:They work, but they're not the best. They do a good job of filtering out external noise, when talking to someone, but the quality isn't as good as a wired boom mic, or a wired in-line mic from a wired set of earbuds. Unfortunately, I don't think this is Amazon's fault as much as it is just the limitations of the bluetooth protocols and the location of the mics. Apple and their copycats with stems on their earbuds may get a better sound if only because there is a dumb-looking stem bringing the microphones closer to your mouth.Passthrough/ANC:I'll rate these together since they're basically inverses of eachother; ANC does a decent job of bringing down some of the perceived sound in your environment... it can make me forget my in-window AC or fan is running. It makes my car and airplane rides quieter, which is always pleasant. Passthrough, is sort of like a budget hearing aid: I can customize how powerful it is, and I set it to be more sensitive than my ears normally would be so I can use them to help hear people far away, or who are wearing a mask. It's a surprisingly useful tool to have. My only gripe is that there is a soft, but audible level of white noise than can be heard at all times if either mode is on. This disappears if you disable both listening modes, so I feel it is just a result of the processing the buds are doing, and they're getting confused.Conclusion:Honestly, unless multi-point bluetooth is something you need or want, get these. I'd say get them now, but since it's Amazon, they'll go on sale when prime day comes around in July, or whenever else they feel like having a sale. It ticks all the boxes I had for a pair of earbuds when purchasing them, and (with the exception of multi-point bluetooth), it still does after I have experienced them for a year.",

      "content": "Let me start by saying I am not an audiophile but I am a music lover I go everywhere with earbuds and NEED music always. I was a Galaxy bud pro user for the longest and before I bought the Echo Buds 2 I was in the market for galaxy buds pro2. I really wanted to compare because the Echobuds 2 were on sale and it was an amazing price. I am so glad that I got these earbuds they are hands down my favorite ear buds overall. I hope a Echo Buds 3 is on the market one day I will definitely get themPros:• Sound: They sound amazing, in comparison with the GBpro they sound just as good and that is high praise. I prefer the bass profile on the Echo buds pro 2• Wireless charging: This should be the standard I will not buy earbuds without wireless charging• Passthrough audio: Works really well on these earbuds. The Echo buds have a feature that I love, you can use passthrough with only one ear bud in. I play picklball and listen to music at the same time, the passthrough with one earbud is a great feature• ANC: The ANC on this device is not as good as the galaxy bud pro but it is really good• Fit: I prefer the in ear feel of the galaxy bud pro2 but the fit for the Echo buds 2 is great, they feel great and come with wings. I live the fit test which helped me choose my ear tips. I ran a 5k this week with them on and had no issues did not have to adjust and did not have any issues with wind noise. I have noticed that you may want to turn off the ANC and passthrouh when running, because having them on might cause you to hear more of your stride (hope that make sense) I am not a heavy runner but when I had the pass through on I noticed it a little more. BTW I have had these buds for 4 weeks and I wear them a lot, I have never had ear fatigue wearing them• Alexa built in: What can I say this works well I like how I can turn the volume up and down. One of the things that I did not realize before I got these is the Alexa integration works for all of my enabled devices. I use this all the time, and somehow Alexa knows which device I am talking to.• Case: I first though that I would not like the case because of its profile but I have gotten use to it, it is bigger than the GBpro but it is not very big and does not cause a problem in my pockets. I use the wings and once they got caught in the door because they did not seat correctly but I do not think that is a big deal.Cons:• The only problem with Alexa  is I noticed that if I ask her to pause the music and then un pause she might not get that correct. I have to start the play list over or reshuffle• Fit: The fit for these ear buds are not a real con and this is being really nitpicky, but the fit for the galaxy buds pro is a little better the ear bud fits inside of your ear and it is super snug and feels very natural. The Echo Buds 2 fit really well and I do not have any problems with fit, but  they do sit outside of the ear, which is not bad it is just  not as cool as being inside of the ear. The positive thing about the profile of the EB2 is it is much easier to use the tap functions. I have noticed that the taps are more accurate on these ear buds.• I often play pickleball with one bud in and every once in a while when making a strong move there is a small distortion in the sound, it last less than a second but it is a slight imperfection. the last time I played it maybe happened twice, so not a huge concern.• 3D audio: why no 3d audio? Not a big deal but it would have been cool feature to have• Regular mode: small issue but I wish you could turn on normal mode (no ANC or Pass through) without having to use the app. This is a very small issue and 98% of the time I use ANC or passthrough (and I assume most people do also) so maybe that is why they do not add it",

      "content": "The Echo Earbuds provide good sound for a variety of uses including music, audio books and online meetings. I use them primarily for online meetings, paired to my PC using Teams, and audio books, paired to my iPhone, using Audible or OverDrive.  Pairing to either a PC or iPhone is easy, requiring only a few simple steps.  Once paired to a PC or iPhone the buds automatically connect when you open the case. The buds remember which device you connected with last and that is the device you connect to next time. To switch to another paired device, simply select the buds from the Bluetooth menu on your PC or iPhone.The integration with the Alexa app is superior to that when paired to a PC. In fact, if you want to make any adjustments to how the buds function, you must do this when paired to the Alexa app on a smart phone or tablet.  There are plenty on options for customizing how the buds work including configurable gestures and even an equalizer. I wish there were a way to control these features from the PC.There are four different tip sizes to choose from and three stabilizer sizes.  The Alexa app has an option to determine which size combination of tips (required) and stabilizers (optional) give the best sound results.  Results are graded for each ear as Fair, Good, Excellent.  I have only been able to get a rating of Good on each ear.  No idea why I can't get better than that and I have tried all combinations.In my opinion, these are every bit as good at the Airpods Pro, and quite a bit less expensive.  A lot less expensive if you get them on Prime Day or when otherwise on sale.",

These will work with any Qi charger but the Anker pad is small, has an indendation for the Buds 2 case, and there are status lights for the earbuds and case on the pad.",

I've found myself always popping them in on any long flights across the US.  Whenever you turn off the noise cancellation, it's always shocking just how loud it is inside the plane.  I think my only real complaint is how slick the case is.  I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it under the seat or something.",

      "content": "EDIT/UPDATE: I cannot say this was a result of my own review, but I have raised my review rating by a star to account for this - it seems Amazon through a software update was able to add support for multipoint bluetooth connectivity. As my millennial friends would say, this is an absolute flex on Google, for they only months ago released their Pixel Buds Pro, with multipoint BT connectivity as a flagship feature, but leaving their a-series, gen 1 and gen 2 Pixel Buds users without the feature.Coming from a technical background, I know this can be difficult for other bluetooth device manufacturers to do, most of the time they're using off-the-shelf BT adapters which they cannot update the firmware on themselves (they have to talk with whoever manufactured the bluetooth adapter), and in other cases, its impossible to update it without ripping it out of the device first.Amazon is showing Google up by using their control over the hardware and software of the buds to add features never even dreamed of by the team who designed and released these buds (as evidenced by the lack of mention on the product page), and the fact that I received this in a free software update makes my day.For those curious, my buds are on software version 603267242 and the case is on 602808458. You can enable multipoint by going to the settings page for your Echo Buds and using the \"connected devices\" section to put them in pairing mode. Using the normal pairing mode method (buds in case, lid open, pressing and holding button until blue light flashes), might not cause them to pair in multipoint mode.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Having owned my current pair of Echo buds for nearly a year now, I feel I can give a sufficiently detailed review on them.Case/Chassis:The case itself has a nice sleek design with a slight indent on the side that the lid opens from, allowing you to easily pull the lid open. It's small enough to fit into my jeans pocket alongside my keys and wallet, without falling or sliding out. It can fit into the vestigial pocketwatch pocket, but only barely and peeks out to a degree. The hinge feels a little weak, as if a strong enough force applied to the lid could bend its connection out of snap it entirely, and it feels a touch loose, the main body of the case has a sort of raised section that fits into an indented section of the lid. This gives the lid strength when held closed by its magnets and redirects any forces applied to the lid into the main body of the case.Sound Quality:Better than my car speakers; with the listening modes such as ANC and passthrough turned off, the sound quality is actually rather pleasant. I have unpaired my phone from my 2019 car and use my Echo Buds exclusively in the car when driving, for music and calls since it sounds so much better. Mind, it is recommended that you use the in-app EQ to turn down mids and treble by one or two ticks to even out the sound profile, especially if you listen to bass-heavy music.Fit:Good enough, there are a few pressure points where the body of the earbuds press against my ears and to achieve the recommended fit I have to use tips that are slightly larger than preferred. I could improve comfort by under-sizing the tips and using the wings to keep them stable, but the wing design would worsen the pressure points between my earlobe and the main body, making that the pain-point. I love the color-matched mesh inside the tips, making it easy to tell which size each tip is, and if I am using asymmetric tips (because some people have asymmetric ears), it can help keep track of which bud goes in which ear. In short, I have a listening time of 1-3 hours before the pain gets to me and I have to give my ears a rest... This isn't too bad since the battery is supposed to last 4-5 hours (depending on ANC being enabled, and if I reduce the depth of discharge then it can improve battery lifespan (ex: discharging a battery from 100% to 75% twice is better than going from 100% to 50% once).Battery:Truly wireless earbuds have some of the smallest batteries found in electronics, and manufacturers will push them to the limit to hit lovely marketing figures. Google's new pixel buds pro advertise a listening time with ANC of 7 hours. After a year of use, I can confirm that my Echo Buds are still hitting at least 3-4 hours of listening time with ANC enabled. The case holds about 2 spare charges in it, and I find the combined 9-15 hours of listening to be more than enough for most purposes, especially considering I have to take breaks every 3 hours anyhow.Charging:This is the only failure of the Echo Buds. I like the use of a USB-C charging port, and the optional upgrade for a wireless charging case. After losing multiple phones to charging port failure, I resolve to only purchase devices with wireless charging from now on, and that resolution is why I held off on getting the first-generation Echo Buds. Since the case is more vertical than it's predecessor, that limits the size of the internal wireless charging coil, and resultingly, the buds have issues trying to charge on a charging pad with too large an internal coil. It will handshake, and initiate the charge, giving the user a pleasant blinking green light, and then fail minutes later - this is an issue I saw even with the official Anker charging pad. Worse yet, for some reason the buds seem to always be warm after wirelessly charging for any length of time longer than 5 minutes. I have deducted one star from my review as a result of this.Connectivity / Smarts:The buds are actually fairly nice when it comes to connecting via bluetooth and integration with the Alexa app, Alexa is a pleasant enough assistant and it is nice to be able to turn on and off lights, heaters, AC units, etc as I'm driving away from or towards my home. I have found no issue with the bluetooth connectivity, even in densely crowded areas such as an airplane. Triggering an assistant via a voice command requires their wake-algorithm be running on the receiving device, and since Google and Apple are not going to give Amazon the algorithm required to trigger their assistants via a wake word, this means you're limited to Alexa for truly hands-free operation. That being said, you can setup the Alexa app to trigger your phone's native assistant by pressing and holding one of the buds for 2-3 seconds.***THIS POINT IS MOOT, SEE ABOVE***Despite this, there is room for improvement in regards to bluetooth... They need multi-point bluetooth to be really useful. Amazon should want me to be able to swap between my cell phone, and a Fire Tablet, or a Fire TV at will, and ideally even my PC or steamdeck when mine finally ships. Currently, the best option is to pair and unpair it with multiple devices at a time, which is annoying since to pair (without resetting), you must hold the lid open whilst pressing the button until the light flashes blue. This isn't enough to deduct a star, but Amazon should take it into consideration with the third-gen buds, or in the form of a software update if at all possible.***THIS POINT IS MOOT, SEE ABOVE***Touch controls:At launch, the touch controls were laughably limited in scope, you could only customize what the long touch+hold did. After a few updates, the other touch patterns (single, double, triple) can be customized to an extent, and they're acceptable if barely. Unfortunately, they're capacitive sensors, so they can be triggered by anything touching the buds. The Alexa app also provided limited guidance on how best to trigger them, which caused some frustration at first. For those with these buds: you will want to gently but assertively (eg: the minimum amount of force needed for your finger pad to flatten against the surface) press your finger against it for about a half second per press/tap. Do not angrily tap it like you're hitting a key on your keyboard, it'll only miss the touch.Microphones:They work, but they're not the best. They do a good job of filtering out external noise, when talking to someone, but the quality isn't as good as a wired boom mic, or a wired in-line mic from a wired set of earbuds. Unfortunately, I don't think this is Amazon's fault as much as it is just the limitations of the bluetooth protocols and the location of the mics. Apple and their copycats with stems on their earbuds may get a better sound if only because there is a dumb-looking stem bringing the microphones closer to your mouth.Passthrough/ANC:I'll rate these together since they're basically inverses of eachother; ANC does a decent job of bringing down some of the perceived sound in your environment... it can make me forget my in-window AC or fan is running. It makes my car and airplane rides quieter, which is always pleasant. Passthrough, is sort of like a budget hearing aid: I can customize how powerful it is, and I set it to be more sensitive than my ears normally would be so I can use them to help hear people far away, or who are wearing a mask. It's a surprisingly useful tool to have. My only gripe is that there is a soft, but audible level of white noise than can be heard at all times if either mode is on. This disappears if you disable both listening modes, so I feel it is just a result of the processing the buds are doing, and they're getting confused.Conclusion:Honestly, unless multi-point bluetooth is something you need or want, get these. I'd say get them now, but since it's Amazon, they'll go on sale when prime day comes around in July, or whenever else they feel like having a sale. It ticks all the boxes I had for a pair of earbuds when purchasing them, and (with the exception of multi-point bluetooth), it still does after I have experienced them for a year.",

      "content": "Let me start by saying I am not an audiophile but I am a music lover I go everywhere with earbuds and NEED music always. I was a Galaxy bud pro user for the longest and before I bought the Echo Buds 2 I was in the market for galaxy buds pro2. I really wanted to compare because the Echobuds 2 were on sale and it was an amazing price. I am so glad that I got these earbuds they are hands down my favorite ear buds overall. I hope a Echo Buds 3 is on the market one day I will definitely get themPros:• Sound: They sound amazing, in comparison with the GBpro they sound just as good and that is high praise. I prefer the bass profile on the Echo buds pro 2• Wireless charging: This should be the standard I will not buy earbuds without wireless charging• Passthrough audio: Works really well on these earbuds. The Echo buds have a feature that I love, you can use passthrough with only one ear bud in. I play picklball and listen to music at the same time, the passthrough with one earbud is a great feature• ANC: The ANC on this device is not as good as the galaxy bud pro but it is really good• Fit: I prefer the in ear feel of the galaxy bud pro2 but the fit for the Echo buds 2 is great, they feel great and come with wings. I live the fit test which helped me choose my ear tips. I ran a 5k this week with them on and had no issues did not have to adjust and did not have any issues with wind noise. I have noticed that you may want to turn off the ANC and passthrouh when running, because having them on might cause you to hear more of your stride (hope that make sense) I am not a heavy runner but when I had the pass through on I noticed it a little more. BTW I have had these buds for 4 weeks and I wear them a lot, I have never had ear fatigue wearing them• Alexa built in: What can I say this works well I like how I can turn the volume up and down. One of the things that I did not realize before I got these is the Alexa integration works for all of my enabled devices. I use this all the time, and somehow Alexa knows which device I am talking to.• Case: I first though that I would not like the case because of its profile but I have gotten use to it, it is bigger than the GBpro but it is not very big and does not cause a problem in my pockets. I use the wings and once they got caught in the door because they did not seat correctly but I do not think that is a big deal.Cons:• The only problem with Alexa  is I noticed that if I ask her to pause the music and then un pause she might not get that correct. I have to start the play list over or reshuffle• Fit: The fit for these ear buds are not a real con and this is being really nitpicky, but the fit for the galaxy buds pro is a little better the ear bud fits inside of your ear and it is super snug and feels very natural. The Echo Buds 2 fit really well and I do not have any problems with fit, but  they do sit outside of the ear, which is not bad it is just  not as cool as being inside of the ear. The positive thing about the profile of the EB2 is it is much easier to use the tap functions. I have noticed that the taps are more accurate on these ear buds.• I often play pickleball with one bud in and every once in a while when making a strong move there is a small distortion in the sound, it last less than a second but it is a slight imperfection. the last time I played it maybe happened twice, so not a huge concern.• 3D audio: why no 3d audio? Not a big deal but it would have been cool feature to have• Regular mode: small issue but I wish you could turn on normal mode (no ANC or Pass through) without having to use the app. This is a very small issue and 98% of the time I use ANC or passthrough (and I assume most people do also) so maybe that is why they do not add it",

      "content": "The Echo Earbuds provide good sound for a variety of uses including music, audio books and online meetings. I use them primarily for online meetings, paired to my PC using Teams, and audio books, paired to my iPhone, using Audible or OverDrive.  Pairing to either a PC or iPhone is easy, requiring only a few simple steps.  Once paired to a PC or iPhone the buds automatically connect when you open the case. The buds remember which device you connected with last and that is the device you connect to next time. To switch to another paired device, simply select the buds from the Bluetooth menu on your PC or iPhone.The integration with the Alexa app is superior to that when paired to a PC. In fact, if you want to make any adjustments to how the buds function, you must do this when paired to the Alexa app on a smart phone or tablet.  There are plenty on options for customizing how the buds work including configurable gestures and even an equalizer. I wish there were a way to control these features from the PC.There are four different tip sizes to choose from and three stabilizer sizes.  The Alexa app has an option to determine which size combination of tips (required) and stabilizers (optional) give the best sound results.  Results are graded for each ear as Fair, Good, Excellent.  I have only been able to get a rating of Good on each ear.  No idea why I can't get better than that and I have tried all combinations.In my opinion, these are every bit as good at the Airpods Pro, and quite a bit less expensive.  A lot less expensive if you get them on Prime Day or when otherwise on sale.",

      "content": "I've been using these headphones for a couple of weeks now, and they've really surprised me. The sound quality is very good; the bass feels powerful without drowning out voices or highs. I've tested the active noise cancellation both on the street and in the office, and it really works. It isolates quite well and makes listening to music or watching movies much more immersive.What I liked most is the battery: it lasts a long time. I've used them for several hours a day and haven't had to charge them frequently yet, so those 60 hours of playback aren't excessive. Plus, they're comfortable, don't feel too tight, and the ear cushions feel soft even after using them for several hours straight.The Bluetooth connection is stable, doesn't drop out, and pairs quickly with my phone. Overall, these headphones seem like a very good value, perfect for those looking for good sound, comfort, and long battery life.",

      "content": "I’ve been using this headset for a few days now, and overall it’s a solid pick. The sound quality is clear with a nice balance between bass and treble, making it great for music, calls, and gaming. The microphone picks up voice clearly without too much background noise, which is perfect for online meetings or chats.Comfort-wise, the ear cushions are soft and the headband adjusts easily, so I can wear it for hours without discomfort. The build feels sturdy but still lightweight, which is a big plus. Battery life (if wireless) lasts a good stretch before needing a charge, and the Bluetooth connection is stable with no annoying dropouts.If I had to point out one downside, it’s that the noise isolation could be a bit stronger — you can still hear some outside sounds. But for the price and quality, it’s definitely worth it.",

      "content": "I am only a few hours into utilizing the product but so far it is more than what I need for the video editing project that I'm currently working on. Most importantly, although it's not complete noise canceling say like a Bose system, it does get rid of ambient and white noise which for me as a film editor is highly important to get a better sense of what the pure stereo sound will come out like before I hand it to my actual sound editor. I think it's a great product and would highly recommend it.  Also I am a big fan of the fact that I can take a phone call with the same headset via bluetooth while still connected to my laptop and not need to switch devices or pick up my handset for the phone.",
