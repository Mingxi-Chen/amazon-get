Smith,5.0,"September 1, 2023",True,"I had to return the first one I ordered because it was a tad too small so I browsed again after returning that one and found this one for basically the same price and it has loads of room. The main compartment is huge and padded enough that I feel safe with my expensive gaming laptop in it. There are also other zippered compartments so I was able to also pack my full size keyboard, my trackball mouse, and of course my power supply for the laptop and is still has another zippered compartment for files or manuals, documents, etc. I didn't think I would ever use that one but it has already come in handy. The zippers can be zipped shut so they come together at the top and I got a set of small same keyed padlocks for luggage,etc. and now I can lock the compartments too. I know it could still be stolen if left out somewhere but I still like the fact that not even my friends or family can snoop in my laptop case if I were to leave the room for a minute if we were out together, like if one of us was in the hospital or somewhere that I expect a long wait and might want to use my PC. You could even put a gps tracker inside if you were that worried about it being stolen but I keep a close watch on mine. I don't worry about it when I am at home but I just feel safer with it locked if I take it out somewhere with me. Even if you have a small laptop I would still highly recommend this. It was the best quality laptop case I could find and the price is very reasonable compared to some expensive ones I looked at and didn't even like. If you need a good laptop case that will hold all your accessories then snatch this bag up while you can. In this economy, prices are getting higher every day  on everything and it is only going to get worse. You won't be sorry you got this one.",11

It's become an essential part of my routine, and here's why.First and foremost, the build quality took me by surprise – in the best way possible. It's one of those rare cases where you can judge a book by its cover, or in this case, a bag by its zippers. The zippers are top-notch, and I've always believed that zipper quality is a good indicator of how well-made something is. This bag passes the zipper test with flying colors.Now, let's talk about space – this bag is incredibly roomy. As a self-proclaimed serial over-packer, I often carry more than just my laptop. In this bag, I can comfortably fit not one but two laptops, along with various chargers, pens, notepads, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous items (think gum, AirPods, and even a pocket knife – just in case!).So, if you couldn't tell, I tend to over-prepare for life's little surprises. This laptop bag doesn't judge; it accommodates all my quirks with ease. It's a fantastic companion for anyone who, like me, tends to carry their whole world in their bag. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase, and I'd highly recommend it to fellow over-packers and organized chaos enthusiasts out there.The one con: I can't fit my 36oz yeti in there comfortably!

I don't understand why this bag is so cheap, but I'm not arguing. I just received it, but it appears to be excellent quality. No obnoxious logos or ridiculous alphabet-soup names. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. Hopefully it lasts me many years.I bought the 12"" bag for my 14"" MacBook Pro, and it fits perfectly. I'm guessing this bag is an old design from when laptops had larger bezels, which would explain why I can fit a 14"" in the 12"" bag. My MBP fits great in the main pocket. It's a bit tight in the dedicated laptop pocket with the velcro strap, but it still fits. With the MBP inside, there is still plenty of room for notebooks, pens/pencils and some other small accessories. You could even fit a textbook or two in there with it.The only downside I've found so far is that the strap is just okay, and the strap mounting hardware is plastic. I may replace them someday, but they seem sturdy enough for now--especially since I don't plan to carry a lot of weight in this bag.I'll update this review if I have any problems with longevity.",0

B075Y6Y9H5,"Lenovo Laptop Bag T210, Messenger Shoulder Bag for Laptop or Tablet, Sleek, Durable & Water-Repellent Fabric",Charlie Champorado,4.0,"April 6, 2025",True,"First of all, before buying this bag I bought a Timbuktu bag for my laptop. For anyone who know about Timbuktu bags they are not cheap! Of course because they are made strong and durable. Then, I saw this bag. Way cheaper than the bag I already had for my laptop but you know, once I started using this Lenovo bag I never did go back to its more expensive counterpart. Why? Well because unlike the Timbuktu this is a top loader and has very easy access to things. The other bag is also a top loader but has a flap that needs to be folded away in order to reach for the items. Also, and by the way this is just my pet peeve to bags lol. When I carry the Timbuktu like a briefcase, the weight of the bag contents are not evenly balanced. The Lonovo bag has its handles on the top two sides and makes carrying around comfortable. Of course the Timbuktu has all these pockets and slots for organizing and the Lenovo does lack those features. Plus the Lenovo doesn’t repel rain but I still am using even if it’s raining out and my MacBook Air and phone and chargers are all dry. It’s a good laptop bag. It’s not the best but it could be once you get used to it. Thanks for your time!",6

I don't understand why this bag is so cheap, but I'm not arguing. I just received it, but it appears to be excellent quality. No obnoxious logos or ridiculous alphabet-soup names. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. Hopefully it lasts me many years.I bought the 12"" bag for my 14"" MacBook Pro, and it fits perfectly. I'm guessing this bag is an old design from when laptops had larger bezels, which would explain why I can fit a 14"" in the 12"" bag. My MBP fits great in the main pocket. It's a bit tight in the dedicated laptop pocket with the velcro strap, but it still fits. With the MBP inside, there is still plenty of room for notebooks, pens/pencils and some other small accessories. You could even fit a textbook or two in there with it.The only downside I've found so far is that the strap is just okay, and the strap mounting hardware is plastic. I may replace them someday, but they seem sturdy enough for now--especially since I don't plan to carry a lot of weight in this bag.I'll update this review if I have any problems with longevity.",0

There’s enough room to fit some documents and cords for the electronic product that you are carrying. The shoulder strap will make it easy to transport your equipment. The neutral design can be a great disguise if your electronic product is one of the pricier type. The material used in this makes it very durable. All the benefits this provides and for a great price, you will definitely know it is a great find.",7

For anyone who know about Timbuktu bags they are not cheap! Of course because they are made strong and durable. Then, I saw this bag. Way cheaper than the bag I already had for my laptop but you know, once I started using this Lenovo bag I never did go back to its more expensive counterpart. Why? Well because unlike the Timbuktu this is a top loader and has very easy access to things. The other bag is also a top loader but has a flap that needs to be folded away in order to reach for the items. Also, and by the way this is just my pet peeve to bags lol. When I carry the Timbuktu like a briefcase, the weight of the bag contents are not evenly balanced. The Lonovo bag has its handles on the top two sides and makes carrying around comfortable. Of course the Timbuktu has all these pockets and slots for organizing and the Lenovo does lack those features. Plus the Lenovo doesn’t repel rain but I still am using even if it’s raining out and my MacBook Air and phone and chargers are all dry. It’s a good laptop bag. It’s not the best but it could be once you get used to it. Thanks for your time!",6
